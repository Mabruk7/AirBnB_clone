0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

By establishing a control system for the modules that are installed on our Web page, part one of this project will simulate an Airbnb
application. We're going to do that through the use of a json format database and using object oriented programming, Python data 
translation or command interpretation. This gives you the local database that can easily be edited with special commands, allowing for
a flexible and effective way of managing data.
Installation

To have access to the console use the following command:

git clone https://github.com/mabruk7/AirBnB_clone.git; cd AirBnB_clone

If you want to execute the console use:

python3 console.py

or

./console.py

Testing

If you want to personalize the classes and execute unit tests to confirm that your changes haven't modify the functionality use:

python3 -m unittest discover tests
